**Speaker Notes:**

Each module begins with a 30-minute conceptual overview of key terminology, techniques, and applications.

In this module we'll discuss the importance of reproducible research including benefits, pain points and best practices.

We'll also breifly introduce you to the tools we've adopted for LASER and tools for reproducible research. These tools include GitHub and Posit Cloud for hosting our website and curriculum materials, RStudio for managing research projects, Quarto for documenting and reporting research activities, and R & Python for wrangling, exploring, and modeling data.

Everything we introduce in this presentation you will have an opportunity to explore in much greater depth through the essential readings, code-along, and coding case study.

## What is Reproducible Research?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
In computational sciences like LA:

-   Ideally... researchers can ***replicate*** your findings by following the procedures used to gather the data and run the computer code.

-   Realistically... the data and code used to make a finding are available and sufficient to ***recreate*** the finding.

**Speaker Notes:**

The information from this conceptual overview on reproducible research is drawn largely from the excellent book by Christopher Gandrud, Reproducible research with R and R studio. Even if you're a python user, this is a valuable resource for essential concepts and practices for ensuring that your research is reproducible.

The distinction between these two definitions is that we recognize it is sometimes difficult to replicate the original data set in a study because of issues such as limited resources to gather new data, or because the original study may have already sampled the full universe of cases.

**Speaker Notes:**

**For Science:**

-   **Standard to judge scientific claims.** Reproducibility opens up your findings and work to scrutiny, and is the **minimum** standard for judging scientific claims. However, “a study can be reproducible but still be wrong” (Peng, 2014).

-   **Reproducibility enhances replicability**. If other researchers are able to clearly understand how a finding was originally made, then they will be better able to conduct comparable research, in meaningful attempts to replicate the original findings. However, a finding in one study may be statistically significant when **reproduced** using the original data/code, but when researchers try to **replicate** it using new data and even methods, they are unable to find a similar result. The original finding could have been noise, even though it is fully reproducible.

-   **Avoiding effort duplication**. Reproducible research, in theory, should cut down on the amount of time others have to spend gathering data or developing procedures that have already been collected or figured out.

-   **Cumulative knowledge development.** They can instead use that time to more quickly build on established findings and develop new knowledge.

**For Yourself:**

-   **Better work habits**. It can spur you to more effectively plan and organize your research. It should push you to bring your data and source code up to a higher level of quality than you might if you thought no one was looking.

-   **Better teamwork**. RR makes it easier for your collaborators figure out what you have done also to understand your work and up to speed on a research project.

-   **Changes are easier**. No actual research process is completely linear. You almost never gather data, run analyses, and present your results without going backwards to add variables, make changes to your statistical models, create new graphs, alter results tables in light of new findings. RR makes it easier to reproduce parts or even all of your own research.

-   **Higher impact research.** Reproducible research is more likely to be useful for other researchers than nonreproducible research. Useful research is cited more frequently!

## Reproducible Research?

![](img/phd-comic.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

In practice, your research should be easy for independent researchers to reproduce! If a study is difficult to reproduce, it’s more likely that no one will reproduce it. If someone does attempt to reproduce it, it will be difficult for them to tell if any errors they find were in the original research or problems introduced during the reproduction.

So next we're going to talk about some general best practices for reproducible research, and then give an overview of the research tools we'll be working with throughout the LASER institute to help ensure it's relatively easy to reproduce our research.

## Discussion

Think about the following questions and then discuss at your table:

-   What have your experiences been with reproducible research?

-   What tools have you used to ensure the reproducibility of your work?

-   What questions do you have about reproducible research?

## Best Practices for Reproducible Research

1.  Document everything!

2.  Everything is a (text) file.

3.  All files should be "human readable."

4.  Explicitly tie your files together.

5.  Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.

::: notes
Speaker Notes:

1.  **Document everything!** Obviously, in order to reproduce your research, others must be able to know what you did. Documentation of includes, but is not limited to the data itself, analysis code, the write-up of results, and explanations of these files (e.g. data set codebooks, software information, and so on).

2.  **Everything is a (text) file**. Ideally, your documentation will be stored in the simplest file format possible to store this information. Usually the best file format is as simple but versatile text file like a comma-separated values (CSV) file for storing data, R and python scripts for documenting code, and markdown files like Quarto for articles, webpages, books, and more.

3.  **All files should be human readable.** Treat all of your research files as if someone who has not worked on the project will, in the future, try to understand them. Computer code like R and Python is ‘machine readable’ in that the computer is able to use it to understand what you want to do. However, there is a very good chance that other people (or you six months in the future) will not understand what you were telling the computer to do. So, you need to make all of your files ‘human readable’ by commenting on your code so others can understand its design and purpose.

4.  **Explicitly tie your files together.** Researchers often do not explicitly document the relationships between files that they used in their research. For example, the results of an analysis, for example a table or figure, might be copied and pasted into a presentation document. However, it can be very difficult for future researchers to trace the table or figure back to a particular statistical model and a particular data set without clear documentation. Therefore, you should make an effort to document the links between your files.

5.  **Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available**. Finally, in order for independent researchers to reproduce your work, they need to be able access the files that instruct them how to do this. Files also need to be organized so that independent researchers can figure out how they fit together. So, from the beginning of your research process, you should have a plan for organizing your files and a way to make them accessible.

# The LASER Toolkit

GitHub, Posit, RStudio, Quarto, and R & Python

::: notes
**Speaker Notes:**

One point we want to emphasis is that the tools we use for LASER and that you'll become familiar with over the next year, is that the LASER way of doing things is just one approach. We hope that you find these set of tools useful for your own research and teaching, but we also encourage you to adapt our curriculum to tools that you and the learners you'll be working with are comfortable with.

In fact, we'd love to be able over the course of the year to include in our curriculum alternate formats for our case studies and presentations, such as Jupyter notebooks or versions using Google Collab.
:::

## Tool Types

Reproducible research involves two broad sets of tools:

-   **A Reproducible Research Environment**, that includes the statistical tools you need to run your analyses; automatically track the provenance of data, analyses, and results; and to package them for redistribution”.

-   **A Reproducible Research Publisher** that prepares dynamic documents for presenting results and is easily linked to the reproducible research environment.

## GitHub

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The [LASER Institute GitHub](https://github.com/laser-institute) site houses repositories for all curriculum materials and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is used to publish our site to the web.

**Speaker Notes:**

GitHub is an interface and cloud hosting service built on top of the Git version control system. GitHub was originally designed to for programmers to work together to build computer programs, but has become widely used by researcher and educators to host statistical software packages, course websites and books, and even online tutorials.

We won't be using GitHub directly, but I did want to note that if you click the link, it will take you to our GitHub organization site where you will find our of the course materials stored as Repositories, or repos, including the laser-orientation repository you just opened.

Later, you'll be learning how to use this GitHub site to adapt these materials for your own instruction.

*\[Prompt scholars to click the link and then give them a very brief tour of the LASER GitHub site including the repositories for each method.\]*
