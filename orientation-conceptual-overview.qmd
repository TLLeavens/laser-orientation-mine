## What is Reproducible Research?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
In computational sciences like LA:

-   Ideally... researchers can ***replicate*** your findings by following the procedures used to gather the data and run the computer code.

-   Realistically... the data and code used to make a finding are available and sufficient to ***recreate*** the finding.

## Reproducible Research?

## Discussion

Think about the following questions and then discuss at your table:

-   What have your experiences been with reproducible research?

-   What tools have you used to ensure the reproducibility of your work?

-   What questions do you have about reproducible research?

## Best Practices for Reproducible Research

1.  Document everything!

2.  Everything is a (text) file.

3.  All files should be human readable.

4.  Explicitly tie your files together.

5.  Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.

## The Tools of Reproducible Research

::: panel-tabset
### Tool Types

Reproducible research involves two broad sets of tools:

1.  *A Reproducible Research Environment*, that includes the statistical tools you need to run your analyses; automatically track the provenance of data, analyses, and results; and to package them for redistribution‚Äù.

2.  *A Reproducible Research Publisher* the prepares dynamic documents for presenting results and is easily linked to the reproducible research environment.
