## Overview

The primary goal of our essential readings in the LASER Orientation module is to introduce learners to foundational concepts and practical tools necessary for conducting reproducible research. Learners will explore the importance of reproducibility in scientific inquiry, understand the benefits it offers to individual researchers and the broader scientific community, and learn about the essential tools and workflows that facilitate reproducible research. The discussion questions aim to deepen students' comprehension of these topics, encourage critical thinking about the practices and principles of reproducible research, and provide practical insights into implementing these methods in their own research projects.

## Readings

Read chapters 1 and 2 of [Reproducible Research with R and RStudio](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book) by @gandrud2021, which lay the groundwork for understanding and implementing reproducible research:

-   **Chapter 1: Introducing Reproducible Research**. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of reproducible research, emphasizing its importance for scientific integrity and personal research efficiency, and outlines the main tools and practices essential for achieving reproducibility in computational and quantitative empirical sciences.

-   **Chapter 2: Getting Started with Reproducible Research**. Chapter 2 provides a detailed workflow for conducting reproducible research, offering practical tips for documenting and organizing research projects to ensure all steps are transparent and easily replicable by others.
