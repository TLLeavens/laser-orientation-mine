# LASER Learning Lab Orientation

The LASER learning lab orientation focuses on reproducible research and the data-intensive research workflow and is designed to orient you to the following instructional activities that make up each LASER learning lab:

1.  [**Overview Presentation**](https://laser-institute.github.io/laser-orientation/laser-lab-slides.html?panelset=r&panelset1=research-context&panelset2=eda&panelset3=goal&panelset4=data-products#1)**:** Each lab consists of a two-part interactive presentation 60-minutes in length and include a conceptual overview of key techniques and an interactive code-along. Part I provides an overview of key concepts, techniques, and applications of , including opportunities for discussion to check participant understanding and connect content with their research interests. The second part provides a short but highly structured code-along activity that demonstrates key R packages and functions required for specific data analysis techniques highlighted in each lab.

2.  **Case Study** activities demonstrate how key data-intensive research workflow processes as featured in exemplary STEM education research studies can be implemented in R. These walkthroughs also provide the holistic setting needed to explore important transversal topics integral to data analysis such as the impact on learning processes, ethics, privacy, diversity, and inclusion.The Data-Intensive Research Workflow is guided by Chapter 3 from Learning Analytics Goes to School (Krumm et al., 2018) and compares teacher perceptions and student reports of classroom middle school friendship and helps reinforce the importance of treating behavioral and cognitive classroom friendship networks and ties as distinct. Upon successful completion of this case study.

3.  [Essential Readings](#0) and case study in this lab is to help LASER Scholars gain a general understanding of benefits, as well as develop a basic comfort level with representing networks visually.

4.  **Badge**. At the end of the orientation presentations, we will cover the hands-on work of completing a Learning Lab case study to earn your first LASER badge (shown above).

Introduction to the concepts of open science and reproducible research for application to learning analytics using R and R Studio.The focus of our essential readings are to get LASER scholars oriented to the essentials of reproducible research. The Code-along includes introduction to the R integrated development environment and R basics (packages, functions, objects, and arguments). Understanding the basic syntax is key for using R and R packages. Written by Catherine Noonan, Jeanne McClure, Presented by Shaun Kellogg and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.

This presentation provides a conceptual overview of reproducible research, particularly as it pertains to open science, and describe the core practices of reproducible research.

The accompanying walkthrough introduces Github Desktop as a tool for the creation of new repositories, cloning the LASER Learning Lab repositories, and navigating to the resulting local copy of the repository to make changes to the files contained within the project. At the end of this walkthrough, we will have an R project set up for the next presentation in this orientation session.

After completing the walkthrough and code-along accompanying these orientation presentations, we will wrap up by examining our code changes in Github Desktop and introduce the concept of committing and pushing our changes to [github.com](https://github.com/). Finally, we will introduce setting up Github Pages as an easy means of sharing research online directly from a Github repository.
