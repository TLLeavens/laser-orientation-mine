# LASER Institute Goals

.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[This Year]

1. **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Deepen understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2. **Technical Skills:** Develop proficiency with R, Posit Cloud, and other tools for reproducible and collaborative data-intensive research.

3. **Social Capital:** Expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

]

.panel[.panel-name[This Week]

1. **Have fun.** Learning new methods can be rewarding but hard, especially when coding is involved, but we want to you enjoy yourselves this week.  
2. **Make Connections** We have an amazing groups of scholars participating this year, use this opportunity to get to know them better. 
3. **Develop a plan.** You won't become an expert in LA overnight, but we want to you leave Friday with a plan to continue learning and apply it to your research. 
4. **Earn two badges.** You'll be exposed to many new concepts and techniques this week, we want you to dig in and demonstrate what you've learned. 
5. **Provide Feedback.** We've revamped our curriculum and need your input to figure out what works well and how we can improve.
