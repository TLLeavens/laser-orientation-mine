## Goals of the LASER Institute 

The LASER Institute is a year-long professional development program designed to build the capacity of participating scholars in three core areas:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2.  **Technical Skills**: Develop proficiency with R/Python, Quarto, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3.  **Social Capital**: Expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

## Structure of LASER  

The LASER Institute consists of two core components:

1.  **Summer Workshop**: An intensive 5-day program consisting of learning labs, guest speakers, planning sessions, and community-building activities.

2.  **Online Community**: An online community of practice for ongoing networking and support throughout the year.

## Summer Workshop Sessions

### Pre-Institute

Prior to the Summer Workshop, participants:

1.  complete a **needs assessment** to identify their teaching interests, experience with software packages, and skills and knowledge in relation to LA and advanced methods;

2.  work through basic **R/Python tutorials** beginning in May and which must be completed prior to the workshop;

3.  engage in an initial **community building activity** designed to get to know each other prior to the Summer Institute.

### Community

### Design

Each day includes small group activities to help participants:

-   design a customized instructional plan at their home institutions;

-   adapt curriculum and technology resources for their own contexts;

-   gather feedback to improve instructional materials.

### Guest Speakers

LASER faculty, scholars, and Advisory Board members discuss LA related topics such as:

-   researcher-practitioner partnerships

-   legal and ethical issues

-   emerging techniques

-    frameworks and workflow

-   teaching computational research methods

## Online Community

Ongoing support is provided to participants during the academic year through:

-   **Virtual Module Sessions** are offered to scholars every month to continue their professional learning.

-   **Monthly Check-Ins** for community building and to gauge progress on implementing instructional plans.

-   **Asynchronous Activities consisting** of facilitated discussion channels and informal Q&As are hosted on our [Slack workspace](#0).

-   **Resource Repositories** housing all the curriculum materials needed to teach with, and learn from, the LASER curriculum.
