## The Friday Institute for Educational Innovation

At The Friday Institute, **our mission is to advance K-12 education through innovation** in teaching, learning and leadership so that ALL students are prepared to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

-   **Educate.** We conduct research, evaluation and professional learning.

-   **Innovate.** We design supports, tools and structures for educational change.

-   **Inspire.** We convene and collaborate with partners in education, government and private industries to inform standards, policy and practice.

The LASER Institute is a prime example of how we [Think and Do](https://www.ncsu.edu/think-and-do/) at the Friday Institute and we hope that you will carry this mission and vision forward!

## Goals of the LASER Institute

::: panel-tabset
## This Year

-   **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

-   **Technical Skills**: Develop proficiency with R/Python, Quarto, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

-   **Social Capital**: Expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

## This Week

-   **Have fun.** Learning new methods can be rewarding but hard, especially when coding is involved, but we want to you enjoy yourselves this week.

-   **Make Connections** We have an amazing groups of scholars participating this year, use this opportunity to get to know them better.

-   **Develop a plan.** Create a SHARK goal for teaching colleagues or students at their home institutions using curriculum materials developed for the LASER Institute.

-   **Earn two badges.** You'll be exposed to many new concepts and techniques this week, we want you to dig in and demonstrate what you've learned.

-   **Provide Feedback.** We've revamped our curriculum and need your input to figure out what works well and how we can improve.

## Today

1.  **Community Building (9:15)** - Affinity groups, badges and SHARK goals, oh my!

2.  **Learning Lab Intros (10:00)** - Learn about reproducible research and the data-intensive research workflow in our LASER Learning Lab orientation.

3.  **Lunch (12:30)** - Eat some great food, connect with new colleagues.

4.  **Scholar TA Panel (1:30)** - Meet three of our past scholars who'll be assisting throughout the week and learn about their LA journey.

5.  **Method Overviews (2:15)** - Learn about our four concentration areas (FS, ML, TM, and SNA) and accompanying labs and select a learning path this week.

6.  **Field Trip (4:30)** - Ice cream party at NC State's dairy farm!
