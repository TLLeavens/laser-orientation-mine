## Welcome Notes

1.  Welcome to the Friday Institute!

2.  Meet the LASER Team

3.  Program Components

4.  Goals for the Year, the Week, and Today

## The Friday Institute for Educational Innovation

At The Friday Institute, **our mission is to advance K-12 education through innovation** in teaching, learning and leadership so that ALL students are prepared to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

-   **Educate.** We conduct research, evaluation and professional learning.

-   **Innovate.** We design supports, tools and structures for educational change.

-   **Inspire.** We convene and collaborate with partners in education, government and private industries to inform standards, policy and practice.

The LASER Institute is a prime example of how we [Think and Do](https://www.ncsu.edu/think-and-do/) at the Friday Institute and we hope that you will carry this mission and vision forward!

## LASER Ice Breaker

### **Two (Surprising) Truths and a (Believable) Lie**

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**How to Play:**

1.  Each person will share three statements about themselves.

2.  Two of the statements should be true, and one should be a lie.

3.  The group will try to guess which statement is the lie.

## Goals of the LASER Institute

::: panel-tabset
### This Year

-   **Learn from LASER**. Scholars will learn about LA and it's application to STEM Ed research and how to apply LA to their own research.

-   **Teach with LASER**. Scholars will teach other faculty or students at students about LA concepts, methods, and applications to research.

-   **Network at LASER**. Scholars will form new connections with other participants and ideally collaborate on a teaching or research project.

### This Week

-   **Have fun.** Learning new methods can be rewarding but hard, especially when coding is involved, but we want to you enjoy yourselves this week.
-   **Develop a plan.** Create a SHARK goal for teaching colleagues or students at their home institutions using curriculum materials developed for the LASER Institute.
-   **Make Connections** We have an amazing groups of scholars participating this year, use this opportunity to get to know them better.
-   **Earn two badges.** You'll be exposed to many new concepts and techniques this week, we want you to dig into a small subset and demonstrate what you've learned.
-   **Provide Feedback.** We've revamped our curriculum and need your input to figure out what works well and how we can improve.

### Today

1.  **LASER Orientation (9:40)** - Learn about the LASER toolkit, reproducible research, and the data-intensive research workflow.
2.  **Lunch (12:30)** - Eat some great food, connect with new colleagues.
3.  **Guest Speaker (1:15)** - Meet our first Advisory Board member and guest speaker and get their perspective on Learning Analytics.
4.  **Method Orientation (2:15)** - Learn more about your selected method area (LAW, ML, TM, KT, and SNA) and get set up for the week.
5.  **Design Session (3:00)** - Identify your SHARK Goal and begin the planning process for teaching others at you home institution or elsewhere.
6.  **Field Trip (4:30)** - Ice cream party at NC State's dairy farm!
