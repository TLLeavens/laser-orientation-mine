# What is Reproducible Research? 

.pull-left[
In computational sciences like LA:
- Ideally... researchers can ***replicate*** your findings by following the procedures used to gather the data and run the computer code.
- Realistically... the data and code used to make a finding are available and sufficient to ***recreate*** the finding.

???
The information from this conceptual overview on reproducibile research is drawn largely from the excellent book by Christopher Gandrud,Reproducible research with R and R studio. 

The distinction between these two definitions is that we recognize that it is sometimes difficult to replicate the original data set in a study because of issues such as limited resources to gather new data, or because the original study may have already sampled the full universe of cases.

##For Science

###Standard to judge scientific claims 
Reproducibility opens up your findings and work to scrutiny, and is the **minimum** standard for judging scientifc claims. However, “a study can be reproducible but still be wrong” (Peng, 2014).

###Reproducibility enhances replicability. 
If other researchers are able to clearly understand how a finding was originally made, then they will be better able to conduct comparable research, in meaningful attempts to replicate the original findings. However, a finding in one study may be statistically signifcant when **reproduced** using the original data/code, but when researchers try to **replicate** it using new data and even methods, they are unable to find a similar result. The original finding could have been noise, even though it is fully reproducible.

### Avoiding effort duplication



### Cumulative knowledge development

# Reproducible Research?

&lt;img src="img/phd-comic.jpeg" height="500px"/&gt;

???

In practice, your research should be easy for independent researchers to reproduce! If a study is difficult to reproduce, it’s more likely that no one will reproduce it. If someone does attempt to reproduce it, it will be difficult for them to tell if any errors they find were in the original research or problems introduced during the reproduction.

So next we're going to talk about some general best practices for reproducible research, and then give an overview of the research tools we'll be working with throughout the LASER institute to help ensure it's relatively easy to reproduce our research. 

---
# Best Practices for Reproducible Research 

## 1. Document everything! 
## 2. Everything is a (text) file. 
## 3. All files should be human readable. 
## 4. Explicitly tie your files together. 
## 5. Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.

# The Tools of Reproducible Research

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Tool Types]
Reproducible research involves two broad sets of tools: 
1. *A Reproducible Research Environment*, that includes the statistical tools you need to run your analyses; automatically track the provenance of data, analyses, and results; and to package them for redistribution”. 

2. *A Reproducible Research Publisher* the prepares dynamic documents for presenting results and is easily linked to the reproducible research environment.

## So why reproducible research?

Reproducible research increases your ability to replicate a study and the ability to develop knowledge cumulatively over time and enable contributions from different sources. 

Gandrud 2020 and Harrison et al 2020 – make the point that adhering to principles of reproducible research improves your work habits and your teamwork. It also eases revision of a project or a study and reduces effort duplication. And all of these things result in higher impact research.

The piece here that I think links reproducible research and open science very well and helps support some of those advantages to open science that we discussed a few slides ago is that scientific inquiry and scientific progress rely heavily upon the ability to reproduce the conditions of an experiment or a research study. 

That's very difficult to achieve if there's missing information about how the research occured in the first place. 

When you use reproducible research techniques, however, all of the steps, all of the components are publicly available. This even includes the version of the software package that you used to analyze your data. And we're going to talk about what some of those procedures are and what some of those standards are for producing reproducible research. But I hope you can see the link between clearly and openly communicating how you've set up a study and how that might contribute to this notion of open science.

Let's talk about the sort of nitty-gritty of how you might go about producing reproducible research. 
First, I want to call your attention to this quote from that Harrison article. It says “the communication aspect should not be an afterthought. It should be recorded with your analysis as you are going through it.” 

So you might relate this to a situation where you're giving a person directions. We don't do this very much anymore because most people will just use their GPS or Google maps but in the olden days if you were giving someone directions, say, to your house, you would give them fairly explicit step by step directions. You would tell them what street names they would expect to see, you would tell them where to turn and which direction to turn, and you would probably also describe very obvious landmarks that they might see along the way. Well reproducible research is very similar in that as you go through the research process, you are also creating a set of directions for someone following behind you. That person may very well be yourself at a later time or it might be someone else, but either way, you're creating this set of directions for someone to reproduce your work as closely as possible to the way you produced it yourself. 


## Core Practices
Some core practices of reproducible research are grouped into these three categories: your research is well documented, you communicate clearly, and you use reproducible theory. 


**Well documented research** includes a read_me file. We will talk a little bit later about some places where you might share your work to make it publicly accessible. GitHub is one such location where you might share your work, including your code that you write. It's standard procedure to include a readme file in your GitHub folder for a given project. That readme file is essentially like the instructions at the top of a worksheet. It tells you where to begin and helps orient you to the entire project. 

Some other aspects of documentation that are important to include are the use of code books. So if you're using variables to represent certain things, or if you're doing qualitative research and you have established a certain set of codes, it behooves you to explain what those variables stand for, and define what those qualitative codes represent. 

Ideally you're also going to include your validation procedures. So you'll share with future you or  other researchers how you validated your processes and tools that you used. You should also include your inclusion criteria: So how did you determine whether participants were appropriate for inclusion in your study? Of course you also want to include the primary research questions that guided your project. And you should consider including a rough abstract of the project as a whole. 


In the category of **clear communication** you want to make sure that you include explanatory headers for source code files. And hopefully that's self-explanatory but basically you're going to want to tell people what the code file does. Some other things that are important to include in that explanatory header would be the author or authors, as well as packages that were necessary for that code to run, and versions of packages and software that were used. 

Another really critical piece of reproducible research in R, or really in any coding language, is that you make sure you comment your code. 

So commenting your code, which will see an example of a little bit later, essentially means that you're going to include a note along with a piece of code that describes the purpose and function of that code. We have a way of annotating that explanatory message, using a pound sign in front of each line of the message, which tells the computer not to read it as code. You will often hear this referred to as “commenting something out”.

Another basic principle of clear communication is making sure that you're using plain language. So try, as best as you are able, to steer clear of jargon or discipline-specific terms. Or, if you use these terms, try to define them. And then lastly, in terms of clear communication, you want to share your rationale for using particular functions as well as the methods that you used in your study. 


The last category listed here is this notion of ***reproducible theory** and essentially this is very basic to research and academia but it means that you are going to appropriately cite any foundational works, or sources, or proofs if you're working in mathematics, so that people who are looking at your research project understand where some of these ideas and concepts that informed your study have come from.

Gandrud 2020 suggest following a Workflow for reproducibility to achieve long-term and cross-platform computational reproducibility of data analysis.

This diagram is from the Gandrud text it's an example workflow and I thought this would be helpful because it illustrates this concept of being explicit about how things are tied together.

In the sort of top part of the diagram you see the research process. There's raw data, it's gathered, it's analyzed, and then it is published or presented using any of these tools that are listed off to the right. Then at the bottom you see different packages and files that are used at each stage of this process to get from one stage to the next. 

This diagram is a really nice example of explaining not only what's happening in each stage of the research process but also how these stages are tied together. 

Gandrud also makes a point that everything should be human readable and everything should be a text file. Basically that's because the text file is going to be the easiest to read by the greatest number of readers, and that includes human readers and also computer readers.

Then this notion that everything should be human readable is hopefully pretty understandable but basically explains that if you're communicating with other human researchers you want to make sure that your explanations are understandable by other humans. This also links to the concept of using plain language. Gandrud explains this probably much more eloquently than I can and much more clearly so again I encourage you to refer to his text.

**What is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?**

So this is an image of the R studio integrated development environment. You can see that there are these four main panels and if you're not seeing all four of those panels it's probably because something has been minimized and we can show you how to fix that here in person.

The IDE four main areas
- Console (&amp; Terminal)
- Scripting and Viewing Window
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help
- Environment (&amp; Connections/Git)

**CONSOLE:**
The console will show you what items have been run and any errors
The terminal provides access to the system shell. By default it is in the bottom left of your screen and you can view your script output here depending how you set up your global options.

***Scripting and Viewing:**
The Script Window is the place to enter and run your code so that it is easily edited and saved for future use.
Two ways to execute your code in the R script, you can either highlight the code and click on Run, or you can highlight the code and press CTRL + Enter on your keyboard.

**Environment Window:**
The Environment tab allows you to see what objects are in the work space.
The history tab allows you to see the commands that you have entered.
The git tab from your project allows you to connect and update right to Github.

**Files pane**
Access all of your files for a projects
- view your plots (data visualizations)
- view what packages are installed
- the help tab will show you more information about a function or package similar to adding a question mark before a package name or function name.
- view your Rmarkdown file 

We can use 
**Global options:** to customize the IDE to better suite your workflow with things like...
- wrap code
- change color scheme
- move panes around
- so much more

Let's set up our Global Options for a smooth workflow
- In the menu bar click `Tools` then `Global Options.`
    + 1. `R General` -&gt; (untick) Restore .RData into workspace at startup.
    + 2. `R General` -&gt; Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never
    + 3. `R Markdown` -&gt; Show output preview in: Viewer Pane


Today we will be working in a script file. A script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments. The script can be saved and used later to re-execute the saved commands

To open a new script file 
  + `file` -&gt; (click) `New file` -&gt; `script`
  
*HINT* - make sure to `save as` and save in your correct folder.

However, we already have our script created that you copied frm Github.

Now let's talk a little bit about some r programming basics: packages, functions, and arguments. 

**Packages** are bundles of functions, and if that is meaningless to you it's probably also helpful to know that functions do things. So packages are bundles of things that do things. And like we just talked about, packages must be first be installed into Rstudio using the install packages function and then loaded into the library using the library function. 

**Functions** are things that do things and so one example would be the function mean which finds the mean of a series of numbers or a vector of numbers. A function always includes the parentheses and whatever is inside the parentheses indicates the thing to which the function is being done. And that thing to which the function is being done is called an argument. 

**Arguments** go inside the parentheses and they are separated by commas. You can have more than one argument within the parentheses. Arguments provide extra details regarding how a function should run or what materials a function should work with. And I've included a couple of examples here.

# Prepare

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Research Context]
.pull-left[
## The Study 
  
The setting of this study was a public provider of individual online courses in a Midwestern state. Data was collected from two semesters of five online science courses and aimed to understand students motivation. 
]

.pull-right[
## Research Question 

Is there a relationship between the time students spend in a learning management system and their final course grade?

]

]


.panel[.panel-name[Packages]

Sometimes referred to as "libraries", packages are shareable collections of R code that can contain functions, data, and/or documentation.


```r
# Load the {tidyverse} package

library(tidyverse)

# How to install the package if not already installed
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# Note this code is commented out so it will not run
```

]

.panel[.panel-name["Read" Data]

The {readr} tidyverse package has several functions like `read_csv()` for importing rectangular data from delimited text files such as comma-separated values (CSV), a preferred file format for reproducible research. 


```r
# "read" into your R environment the sci-online-classes.csv file 
# stored in the data folder of your R project and
# save as a new data "object" named sci_data 

sci_data &lt;- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv", 
                     col_names = TRUE)
```

R has also packages for proprietary data formats like .xls, .sas, and .dat. 
]

.panel[.panel-name[Inspect Data]
You should now see a new data "object" named `sci_data` saved in your Environment pane. Try clicking on it and see what happens!

Now let's "print" the output to our Console to view another way:


```r
# print data to console to view

sci_data
```

What variables do you think might help us answer our research question? 
]

.panel[.panel-name[R Syntax]
The R language can express complex ideas like in this simple "sentence": 

`sci_data &lt;- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv", col_names = TRUE)`

- *Functions* are like verbs: `read_csv()`
- *Objects* are the nouns: `read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv")`
- *Arguments* are like adverbs: `read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv", col_names = TRUE)`
-	*Operators* are like “punctuation” `sci_data &lt;- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv", col_names = TRUE)`
]

# Wrangle

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, ["tidying"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html?q=tidy%20data#tidy-data-1), and transforming data. In Learning Analytics, it often involves merging (or joining) data from multiple sources. 

Run the following code chunk to `select()` the `student_id` and `course_id` from our 


```r
# select student_id and course_id and save as 

select_sci_data &lt;- sci_data |&gt; 
  select(student_id, course_id)

# select two variable you think can help answer our research question and save as an object with a new name
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Note the use of a the powerful `|&gt;` operator called a **pipe**, which are used for combining a sequence of functions or processes.

# Explore

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[EDA]
Exploratory data analysis involves processes of **describing** your data numerically or graphically and often involves: 
- **calculating** summary statistics like frequency, means and standard deviations
- **visualizing** your data through charts and graphs 

EDA can be used to help answer research questions or generate new questions about your data, discover relationships between and among variables, and create new variables (i.e., feature engineering) for data modeling.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Graph Template]
The [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) package follows a common [graphing workflow](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html?q=template#a-graphing-template) for making graphs. To make a graph, you simply:

1. Start the graph with `ggplot()` function and include your data as an argument;
2. "Add" elements to the graph using the `+` operator `a geom_()` function;
3. Select variables to graph on each axis with the `aes()` argument.

A common graphing template is as simple as two lines of code: 

```r
ggplot(&lt;DATA&gt;) + 
  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(aes(x = &lt;VARIABLE1&gt;, y = &lt;VARIABLE2&gt;))
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[Our First Graph!]

Scatterplots use the point **geom**, i.e., the `geom_point()` function, and are most useful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables.


```r
# plot
ggplot(sci_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = TimeSpent, y = FinalGradeCEMS))
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Interpret Graph]

# Model

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Goal]
Modeling involves a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset. According to Krumm et al. (2018), there are two general types of modeling approaches: 
- **Unsupervised** learning algorithms can be used to understand the structure of one’s dataset. 
- **Supervised** models, on the other hand, help to quantify relationships between features and a known outcome.

Ideally, a good model will separate true “signals” (i.e. patterns generated by the phenomenon of interest) from the “noise” (i.e. random variation that you’re not interested in).
]


.panel[.panel-name[A Simple Model]

We'll dive much deeper into modeling in subsequent learning labs, but for now let's see if there is a statistically significant relationship between students' final grades, `FinaGradeCEMS`, and the `TimeSpent` in the LMS:


```r
m1 &lt;- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent, data = sci_data)

summary(m1)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Interpret]


```
##

## lm(formula = FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent, data = sci_data)

## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -67.136  -7.805   4.723  14.471  30.317

# Communicate

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Data Products]
Krumm et al. (2018) have outlined the following 3-step process for communicating finding with education stakeholders: 

1. **Select.** Selecting analyses that are most important and useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a format for displaying that info (e.g. chart, table).

2. **Polish.** Refining or polishing data products, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3. **Narrate.**  Writing a narrative pairing a data product with its related research question and describing how best to interpret and use the data product.
