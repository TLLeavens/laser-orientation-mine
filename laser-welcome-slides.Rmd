# The Friday Institute for Educational Innovation

At The Friday Institute, **our mission is to advance K-12 education through innovation** in teaching, learning and leadership so that ALL students are prepared to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

- **Educate.** We conduct professional learning, research and evaluation.
- **Innovate.** We design supports, tools and structures for educational change.
- **Inspire.** We convene and collaborate with partners in education, government and private industries to inform standards, policy and practice.

The LASER Institute is a prime example of how we [Think and Do](https://www.ncsu.edu/think-and-do/) at the Friday Institute and we hope that you will carry this mission and vision forward!

.panel[.panel-name[Community]
We've partnered with [Participate, Inc.](https://www.participate.com) to help us: 
- develop in-person and online **community-building activities**
- organize **affinity groups** for collaborative research 
- structure monthly **progress updates** with scholars
- facilitate online **discussions forums** 
]


.panel[.panel-name[Planning & Research]

Time and support is provided for scholars to develop a professional learning plan and work with your own data to further research goals.

> *I am thrilled to share with you all about a recently funded project that was influenced by my participation in LASER.  I hope also to continue growing collaborations that have emerged out of this community!*

# LASER Institute Goals

.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[This Year]

1. **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Deepen understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2. **Technical Skills:** Develop proficiency with R,  GitHub and other tools for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3. **Social Capital:** Expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

]

.panel[.panel-name[This Week]

1. **Have fun.** Learning new methods can be rewarding but hard, especially when coding is involved, but we want to you enjoy yourselves this week.  
2. **Make Connections** We have an amazing groups of scholars participating this year, use this opportunity to get to know them better. 
3. **Develop a plan.** You won't become an expert in LA overnight, but we want to you leave Friday with a plan to continue learning and apply it to your research. 
4. **Earn two badges.** You'll be exposed to many new concepts and techniques this week, we want you to dig in and demonstrate what you've learned. 
5. **Provide Feedback.** We've revamped our curriculum and need your input to figure out what works well and how we can improve. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Today]

1. **Community Building (9:15)** - Get to know some "facts" about your colleagues. 

1. **Learning Lab Intros (10:00)** - Learn about the each topic area (FS, ML, TM, and SNA) and accompanying labs to help choose a learning path this week. 

1. **Scholar Panel (1:30)** - Meet four of our past scholars who'll be assisting  throughout the week and learn ability their LA journey.            

1. **Method Overviews (2:15)** - Learn about our four concentration areas (FS, ML, TM, and SNA) and accompanying labs and select a learning path this week.
